This repository is a collection of various prototypes I've worked on. Each directory contains a different project, showcasing a range of ideas and experiments in Windows desktop development. 

##GoogleBooks (Google books API)
This is a simple project that consumes Google books apis and shows search results for a user query, it also contains some animations using Composition animations.

##DragCanvas (UWP Canvas with draggable button)
This is a prototype for moving a button around while meeting some bound limits.
